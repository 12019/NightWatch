NightWatch
==========

A native android Nightscout client with alerts and google wear integration

## Features
* Scrollable, zoomable graph of bg over last 24 hours
* Retrieves Data from your existing NightScout site
* Customizable High and Low levels for graphs
* Built in Alert Notifications (Still needs a little bit of work)
* Ability to override phone silent mode on bg alerts


## Why is it called NightWatch?
 Because its also an ANDROID WEAR WATCHFACE!!
 
 Except, its really ugly and does not have a proper sleep mode so it will eat up battery relitiviely quickly. In fact, at this point the watchface is more a proof of concept, but will be updated soon!!
