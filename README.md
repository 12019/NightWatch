## Collects BG data from the following sources:
* Dexcom Share Servers (Acts as a follow app for Android!!)
* xDrip
* NightScout Site


## Features
* BG graph on Android Wear watches!
* Scrollable, zoomable graph of bg over last 24 hours
* Customizable High and Low levels for graphs
* 4 Watchfaces
* Lockscreen and Homescreen Widget!!
* Built in Alert Notifications
* Retrieves Data from your existing NightScout site
* Retrieves Data uploaded to Dexcoms servers, no setup required! Just log in!
* Retrieves Data from xDrip locally if both are running on the same phone (No network connection required)

#### NOTE
* if you want the graph, don't choose the ones that say LARGE, they just have bigger numbers and no graphs
* you don't need an android wear watch to use this app, just about any android phone can be used to keep track of BG data!!

## Why is it called NightWatch?
 Because its also an ANDROID WEAR WATCHFACE!!


## Future Updates:
* Nicer in phone app display
* In phone Widget
* MQTT support (once nightscout supports it)
* Alert Builder (set custom alerts for levels by time of day, different alert sounds, all that jazz)
* Preview images of the watchfaces when you are selecting them, sorry, mine wont let me do a screenshot for some reason!

Want to see a particular feature? COOL! let me know!! Just click issues on the top right and make one describing what you would like to see!

(note, you need the phone one installed as well if you intend to use the android wear watchface!)
